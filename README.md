# hello-world
My first repository

Hi,

I made my first program in school, two years ago. My teacher has told me many things about it, because he is mathematician, physicist and computer scientist. I learn c++, after that I'm going to learn html. It is interesting, new technologies is future and I want to learn them.

Greetings, Bodzio
